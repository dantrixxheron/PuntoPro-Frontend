## 🎨 Layout and design

The visual design was created using the following base color palette (generated with Coolors.co):

- Dark blue: #22489B  
- Medium blue: #5E7CE2  
- Light blue: #7898EB  
- Very light blue: #B2CAF5  
- Light gray: #EAF1F4  
- Dark gray: #363845  

Coolors.co color palette viewer was used as a visual reference, providing a clear idea of how to combine these colors to achieve an attractive, functional, and accessible design with sufficient color contrast.
